This simple service allows to authenticate yubikeys using only a small
sqlite database.
The code has been released under GNU license (license into LICENSE file)

To authenticate, call the script yubiserve.php with the parameter otp.
Ex.: yubiserve.php?otp=vviblrbuicuvevcnnedbuuhjfhrebjlchhidkfrdkike

To add a new key, run ./keyconf.py -a <publicname> <internalname> <aeskey>
To delete a key, run ./keyconf.py -k <publicname>
To disable a key (disabling a key won't delete it from the db), run
  ./keyconf.py -d <publicname>
To enable a key, run ./keyconf.py -e <publicname>


The YubiServe service needs the php-sqlite, php-mcrypt and python-sqlite support.
On debian/ubuntu, you can run:
sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt php5-sqlite python-sqlite

About Apache configuration, it is **REALLY IMPORTANT** users are not
allowed to download the yubikeys.sqlite database. For this purpose,
I wrote the .htaccess file into yubiserve directory. Sometimes 
however, into main Apache configuration the AllowOverride parameter
is set to "None", and the .htaccess won't be loaded at all.
If this is your case, be sure to add to your apache configuration the
following lines (change <path to yubiserve>!!!):

        <Directory <path to yubiserve>/>
#ex.	<Directory /var/www/yubiserve/>
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all

                <Files yubiserve.php>
                        Order deny,allow
                        Allow from all
                </Files>
        </Directory>
